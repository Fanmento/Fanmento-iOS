static NSString *const PRIVACY_POLICY = @"￼Privacy Policy\nEffective date: July 22, 2013\nWelcome to Fanmento (\"Fanmento,\" \"we,\" \"us\" or \"our\"). FanmentoTM offers a modern way for fans to engage with and purchase customized licensed photos taken on their mobile device. Fanmento’s GPS enabled software allows fans to take, share and purchase customized licensed photos all within an easy to use and free to download application. Fans can purchase their created image as a photo print or poster via home delivery or in store pickup at select locations. FanmentoTM can also be shared on Twitter, Facebook or Email.\n■ Our Privacy Policy explains how we and some of the companies we work with collect, use, share and protect information in relation to our mobile services, web site, and any software provided on or in connection with Fanmento services (collectively, the \"Service\"), and your choices about the collection and use of your information.\n■ By using our Service you understand and agree that we are providing a platform for you to create content, including photos, share comments and other materials (\"User Content\"), to the Service and to share User Content publicly through third parties (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, and Email). This means that other Users may see, use, or share any of your User Content that you make publicly available through third parties (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, and Email) of the Service, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use (which can be found at http://fanmento.com/legal/terms).\n■ Our Policy applies to all visitors, users, and others who access the Service (\"Users\").\n1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT\nWe collect the following types of information.\nInformation you provide us directly:\n■ Your password and e-mail address when you register for a Fanmento account.\n￼■ Profile information that you provide for your user profile (e.g., first and last name, email).\n■ User Content (e.g., photos, comments, and other materials) that you create and post to the Service.\n■ Communications between you and Fanmento. For example, we may send you Service-related emails (e.g., account verification, changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security notices). Note that you may not opt out of Service-related e-mails.\nAnalytics information:\n■ We use third-party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These tools collect information sent by your device or our Service, including the web pages you visit, add-ons, and other information that assist us in improving the Service. We collect and use this analytics information with analytics information from other Users so that it cannot reasonably be used to identify any particular individual User.\nCookies and similar technologies:\n■ When you visit the Service, we may use cookies and similar technologies like pixels, web beacons, and local storage to collect information about how you use Fanmento and provide features to you.\n■ We may ask advertisers or other partners to serve ads or services to your devices, which may use cookies or similar technologies placed by us or the third party.\nLog file information:\n■ Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you make a request to access (i.e., visit) a web page or app. It can also be provided when the content of the webpage or app is downloaded to your browser or device.\n■ When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information, including your web request, Internet Protocol (\"IP\") address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information. We may also collect similar information from emails sent to our Users which then help us track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients. The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service. Device identifiers:\n■ When you use a mobile device like a tablet or phone to access our Service, we may access, collect, monitor, store on your device, and/or remotely store one or more \"device identifiers.\" Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device's operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by Fanmento.\n■ A device identifier may deliver information to us or to a third party partner about how you browse and use the Service and may help us or others provide reports or personalized content and ads. Some features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.\nMetadata:\n■ Metadata is usually technical data that is associated with User Content. For example, Metadata can describe how, when and by whom a piece of User Content was collected and how that content is formatted.\n■ Users can add or may have Metadata added to their User Content including a hashtag (e.g., to mark keywords when you post a fanmento photo), and comments or other data.\n2. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION\nIn addition to some of the specific uses of information we describe in this Privacy Policy, we may use information that we receive to:\n■ help you efficiently access your information after you sign in\n■ remember information so you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the Service;\n■ provide personalized content and information to you and others, which could include online ads or other forms of marketing\n■ provide, improve, test, and monitor the effectiveness of our Service\n■ develop and test new products and features\n■ monitor metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns\n■ monitor content such as photos, comments, and shared posts concerning possible violations of our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm.\n■ diagnose or fix technology problems\n■ automatically update the Fanmento application on your device\n■ Fanmento or other Users may run contests, special offers or other events or activities (\"Events\") on the Service. If you do not want to participate in an Event, do not use the particular Metadata (i.e. hashtag) associated with that Event.\n3. SHARING OF YOUR INFORMATION\nWe will not rent or sell your information to third parties outside Fanmento without your consent, except as noted in this Policy.\nParties with whom we may share your information:\n■ We may share User Content and your information (including but not limited to, information from cookies, log files, device identifiers, location data, and usage data) with businesses that are in content partnerships with Fanmento (\"Affiliates\"). Affiliates may use this information to help provide, understand, and improve the Service (including by providing analytics) and Affiliates' own services (including by providing you with better and more relevant experiences).\n■ We also may share your information as well as information from tools like cookies, log files, and device identifiers and location data, with third-party organizations that help us provide the Service to you (\"Service Providers\"). Our ￼Service Providers will be given access to your information as is reasonably necessary to provide the Service under reasonable confidentiality terms.\n■ We may also share certain information such as cookie data with third-party advertising partners. This information would allow third-party ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you.\n■ We may remove parts of data that can identify you and share anonymized data with other parties. We may also combine your information with other information in a way that it is no longer associated with you and share that aggregated information.\nParties with whom you may choose to share your User Content:\n■ Any information or content that you voluntarily disclose for posting through third parties (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, and Email) from the Service, such as User Content, becomes available to the public. Once you have shared User Content or made it public, that User Content may be re-shared by others.\n■ If you remove information that you posted to the Service, copies may remain viewable in cached and archived pages of the Service after it has been shared through third parties (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, and Email).\nWhat happens in the event of a change of control:\n■ If we sell or otherwise transfer part or the whole of Fanmento or our assets to another organization (e.g., in the course of a transaction like a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation), your information such as name and email address, User Content and any other information collected through the Service may be among the items sold or transferred. You will continue to own your User Content. The buyer or transferee will have to honor the commitments we have made in this Privacy Policy.\nResponding to legal requests and preventing harm:\n■ We may access, preserve and share your information in response to a legal request (like a search warrant, court order or subpoena) if we have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This may include responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States where we have a good faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized standards. We may also access, preserve and share information when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address fraud and other illegal activity; to protect ourselves, you and others, including as part of investigations; and to prevent death or imminent bodily harm. Information we receive about you may be accessed, processed and retained for an extended period of time when it is the subject of a legal request or obligation, governmental investigation, or investigations concerning possible violations of our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm.\n4. HOW WE STORE YOUR INFORMATION Storage and Processing:\n■ Your information collected through the Service may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Fanmento, its Affiliates or Service Providers maintain facilities.\n■ Fanmento, its Affiliates, or Service Providers may transfer information that we collect about you, including personal information across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world. If you are located in the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that we may transfer information, including personal information, to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction.\n■ By registering for and using the Service you consent to the transfer of information to the U.S. or to any other country in which Fanmento, its Affiliates or Service Providers maintain facilities and the use and disclosure of information about you as described in this Privacy Policy.\n■ We use commercially reasonable safeguards to help keep the information collected through the Service secure and take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you access to your account. However, Fanmento cannot ensure the security of any information you transmit to Fanmento or guarantee that information on the Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed.\n■ Please do your part to help us.

You keep your rights to your Content. Fanmento does not claim any ownership rights in the Content that you display or publish on the Fanmento Websites (\"Posting\"); you are simply granting Fanmento a non-exclusive license to your Content as set forth in these Terms. After Posting, you continue to retain any rights you may have in such Content, and you continue to have the right to use your Content in any way you choose. By Posting any Content on the Fanmento Websites or through the Fanmento Services, you grant to Fanmento an unrestricted, non-exclusive, assignable, sublicensable (through multiple sublicensees), revocable (except as limited below), royalty-free license throughout the universe, to communicate to the public, reproduce, distribute, store, transcode, syndicate, broadcast, reproduce, edit, modify, create derivative works from, and otherwise use and reuse your Content (or any portions or derivative works thereof), through any and all distribution channels and devices, whether now known or hereafter created, and to authorize any third parties to do the same with your Content, solely for non-commercial purposes. This means that your license grant to Fanmento in these Terms authorizes Fanmento to sublicense other Users of the Fanmento Services, to use and exploit your Content for personal and non-commercial purposes. This may include, by way of example and not limitation, the reposting of your Content on third party websites and even the printing of any photographs that you upload, either on a personal printer or through a commercial film processing company. In contrast to other social media and sharing services, no third party is authorized by Fanmento to use your content for any commercial purposes, and you retain all private causes of action you may have against such third parties.\n◦ Not withstanding the immediately preceding paragraph, to the extent Fanmento has ￼sublicensed any of your Content to a third party pursuant to the grant of rights set forth in this paragraph, the sublicense granted to such third party shall survive in perpetuity any revocation of your license grant to Fanmento and shall be irrevocable. Therefore, even though you may remove any of your Content from the Fanmento Services and terminate your license grants to Fanmento with respect to Fanmento Services and terminate your license grants to Fanmento with respect to such Content, any sublicenses made by Fanmento to any third parties with respect to such Content prior to the removal of your Content from the Fanmento Services shall survive in perpetuity notwithstanding your removal of your Content from the Fanmento Services.\n◦ 2.

Fanmento may also use your Content for other advertising and promotional purposes without restriction, including by licensing it to others.\n◦ 3. What Your License Means. Without this license, Fanmento might be unable to provide the Fanmento Services. For example, without the right to modify Member Content, Fanmento might not be able to digitally compress and/or resize photos that Members submit or otherwise format Content to satisfy technical requirements. The license you grant to Fanmento is non-exclusive (meaning you are free to license your Content to anyone else in addition to Fanmento), fully-paid and royalty-free (meaning that Fanmento is not required to pay you for the Content that you post), sublicensable (so that Fanmento is able to use affiliates and third parties such as Internet content delivery networks to provide the Fanmento Services), and worldwide (because the Internet and the Fanmento Services are global in reach).\n◦ 4.

You agree to pay any or all royalties, fees, and any other monies owing any person by reason of any Content posted by you to or through the Fanmento Services and publicly performed, publicly displayed, communicated to the public or otherwise used or exploited.\n◦ b. If you are not the copyright owner of or are not fully authorized to grant rights in all of the elements of the Content you intend to upload or transmit to or through the Fanmento Services, then you must not upload the Content to or through the Fanmento Services.\n◦ c. Confirmation of Rights. Fanmento reserves the right to demand confirmation from you in writing of all authorizations, licenses, permissions, and consents obtained by you (if any) with respect to any third-party materials embodied in Content you upload to or transmit through the Fanmento Services.

SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY, SO THEY MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\nDISPUTE RESOLUTION\n◦ Mandatory Arbitration. Please read this carefully. It affects your rights. YOU AND FANMENTO AND EACH OF OUR RESPECTIVE SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, PREDECESSORS IN INTEREST, SUCCESSORS, AND PERMITTED ASSIGNS AGREE TO ARBITRATION (EXCEPT FOR MATTERS THAT MAY BE TAKEN TO COURT), AS THE EXCLUSIVE FORM OF DISPUTE RESOLUTION EXCEPT AS PROVIDED FOR BELOW, FOR ALL DISPUTES AND CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OR YOUR USE OF THE FANMENTO SERVICES. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, is subject to more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Please visit ￼www.adr.org for more information about arbitration.\n◦ a. Commencing Arbitration. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written notice of intent to arbitrate (a \"Notice\"), or, in the absence of a mailing address provided by you to Fanmento, to you via any other method available to Fanmento, including via e-mail. The Notice to Fanmento should be addressed to: Fanmento, LLC., 223 W. Erie St. Suite 5 NW, Chicago, IL 60654, Attn: CEO (the \"Arbitration Notice Address\"). The Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (2) set forth the specific relief sought (the \"Demand\"). If you and Fanmento do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Fanmento may commence an arbitration proceeding as set forth below. THE ARBITRATION SHALL BE ADMINISTERED BY THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION (\"AAA\") IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION RULES AND THE SUPPLEMENTARY PROCEDURES FOR CONSUMER RELATED DISPUTES (THE \"Rules\"), AS MODIFIED BY THIS AGREEMENT. The Rules and AAA forms are available online at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by writing to the Notice Address. If you are required to pay a filing fee to commence an arbitration against Fanmento, then Fanmento will promptly reimburse you for your confirmed payment of the filing fee upon Fanmento's receipt of Notice at the Arbitration Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration along with a receipt evidencing payment of the filing fee, unless your Demand is equal to or greater than $1,000, in which case you are solely responsible for the payment of the filing fee.\n◦ b. Arbitration Proceeding. The arbitration shall be conducted in the English language. A single independent and impartial arbitrator shall be appointed pursuant to the Rules, as modified herein. You and Fanmento agree to comply with the following rules, which are intended to streamline the dispute resolution process and reduce the costs and burdens on the parties: (1) the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or be solely based on written submissions, the specific manner to be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration; (2) the arbitration shall not require any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing by the parties; and (3) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.\n◦ c. No Class Actions. YOU AND FANMENTO AGREE THAT YOU AND FANMENTO MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. FURTHER, YOU AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE PROCEEDINGS OF MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING, AND THAT IF THIS SPECIFIC PROVISO IS FOUND TO BE UNENFORCEABLE, THEN THE ENTIRETY OF THIS MANDATORY ARBITRATION SECTION SHALL BE NULL AND VOID.\n￼◦ d. Decision of the Arbitrator. Barring extraordinary circumstances, the arbitrator shall issue his or her decision within 120 days from the date the arbitrator is appointed. The arbitrator may extend this time limit for an additional 30 days in the interests of justice. All arbitration proceedings shall be closed to the public and confidential and all records relating thereto shall be permanently sealed, except as necessary to obtain court confirmation of the arbitration award. The award of the arbitrator shall be in writing and shall include a statement setting forth the reasons for the disposition of any claim. The arbitrator shall apply the laws of the State of Illinois in conducting the arbitration. You acknowledge that these terms and your use of the Service evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce. The United States Federal Arbitration Act shall govern the interpretation, enforcement, and proceedings pursuant to the Mandatory Arbitration clause in these Terms.\n◦ 2. These Terms and your use of the Fanmento Services shall be governed by the substantive laws of the State of Illinois without reference to its choice or conflicts of law principles. Only if the Mandatory Arbitration clause is deemed to be null and void, then all disputes arising between you and Fanmento under these Terms shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in Cook County, Illinois, and you and Fanmento hereby submit to the personal jurisdiction and venue of these courts.\n◦ 3. Equitable Relief. The foregoing provisions of this Dispute Resolution section do not apply to any claim in which Fanmento seeks equitable relief of any kind. You acknowledge that, in the event of a breach of these Terms by Fanmento or any third party, the damage or harm, if any, caused to you will not entitle you to seek injunctive or other equitable relief against Fanmento, including with respect to any Content, and your only remedy shall be for monetary damages, subject to the limitations of liability set forth in these Terms.\n◦ 4. Claims. You and Fanmento agree that, notwithstanding any other rights the party may have under law or equity, any cause of action arising out of or related to these Terms or the Service, excluding a claim for indemnification, must commence within one year after the cause of action accrues. Otherwise, such cause of action is permanently barred.\n◦ 5. Improperly Filed Claims. All claims you bring against Fanmento must be resolved in accordance with this Dispute Resolution section. All claims filed or brought contrary to this Dispute Resolution section shall be considered improperly filed. Should you file a claim contrary to this Dispute Resolution section, Fanmento may recover attorneys' fees and costs up to $5,000, provided that Fanmento has notified you in writing of the improperly filed claim, and you have failed to promptly withdraw the claim.\nINDEMNITY\n￼You agree to indemnify and hold Fanmento, its subsidiaries, and affiliates, and their respective officers, agents, partners, and employees, harmless from any loss, liability, claim, or demand, including reasonable attorneys' fees, made by any third party arising out of or relating to your use of the Fanmento Services in violation of this Agreement and/or arising from a breach of this Agreement and/or any breach of your representations and warranties set forth above and/or if any Content that you post on the Fanmento Websites or through the Fanmento Services causes Fanmento to be liable to any third party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Fanmento reserves the right, at your expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter for which you are required to indemnify Fanmento if Fanmento, in its reasonable discretion, concludes that you are not adequately protecting Fanmento's interests or are incapable of protecting Fanmento's interests, and you agree to cooperate with Fanmento's defense of these claims. You agree not to settle any matter without the prior written consent from Fanmento. Fanmento will use reasonable efforts to notify you of any such claim, action or proceeding upon becoming aware of it.\nEXPORT RESTRICTIONS\nYou may not export or re-export any software accompanying the Fanmento Services without (a) the prior written consent of Fanmento; and (b) complying with applicable export control laws and obtaining any necessary permits and licenses.\nOTHER\n◦ 1.
